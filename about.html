        <h1>A Glimpse of me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a people person who loves connecting with others and learning about different perspectives. Throughout my journey in Computer Engineering, I have discovered a deep passion for technology and its limitless potential. I love that with the right tools and knowledge, I can create anything from scratch and bring ideas to life. What excites me the most about technology is how it unites people. As someone who thrives on collaboration and teamwork, I find great joy in building solutions that not only solve problems but also bring communities together. Apart from programming and adapting to new technological environments, my strengths lie in connecting with people, working effectively in teams, and exploring the world. I believe that technology and human connection go hand in hand, and I am passionate about leveraging both to make an impact.
