          <strong> Exam Distribution Optimizer:</strong> This project is an algorithmic solution that efficiently assigns exam schedules to classrooms across multiple degrees and academic years. It leverages data structures such as hash maps and priority queues to balance student distribution, avoid scheduling conflicts, and optimize room occupancy. The goal is to create a fair and practical system that minimizes logistical issues during exam periods.

          <strong> "7 and a Half" Betting Game:</strong> A web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is inspired by the Spanish card game "Siete y Medio." Users place bets, and based on their chosen number, they either win or lose depending on how close they are to the target number without exceeding it. The project focuses on implementing interactive UI elements, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.

          <strong> Google Developer Groups (GDG) on Campus:</strong> While not strictly a programming project, I am the co-lead of the Google Developer Groups (GDG) at my university campus. This role involves organizing workshops, networking events, and hands-on coding sessions to foster a thriving developer community. My focus is on empowering students to learn from each other, collaborate, and innovate in the tech field.
